            <div class="container">
                <p id="line6" class="speaker1">I loved it.</p>

                <p id="line7" class="speaker2">Tell me about it.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p id="line8" class="speaker1">I learned so much. The evolution of it was so complex,</p>
                <p id="line8-1" class="speaker1">it was a complete surprise where we ended up.</p>
                <p id="line8-2" class="speaker1">To me at least. I don’t even know where to start.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line9" class="speaker2">Well, the beginning is usually a good place.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line10" class="speaker1">Well it started with the group formation, based on topic,</p>
                <p id="line10-1" class="speaker1">and sure there were topics I found interesting, but I just</p>
                <p id="line10-2" class="speaker1">knew working with some of the people I met was important</p>
                <p id="line10-3" class="speaker1">for myself right now. This minor was as much about my</p>
                <p id="line10-4" class="speaker1">mental health as it was my education and working with</p>
                <p id="line10-5" class="speaker1">people I can communicate with was important to me.</p>
                <p id="line10-6" class="speaker1">So I joined the “Uncertainty” group.</p>
                <p id="line10-7" class="speaker1">The group with no topic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line11" class="speaker2">No topic?</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p id="line12" class="speaker1">Well that didn’t last long.</p>
                <p id="line12-1" class="speaker1">We almost immediately came up with the idea of</p>
                <p id="line12-2" class="speaker1">“Fictional Space and Human Perception”.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line13" class="speaker2">What does that entail?</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p id="line14" class="speaker1">I don’t know! Isn’t that great!</p>
                <p id="line14-1" class="speaker1">I had to find out before I could start!</p>
                <p id="line14-2" class="speaker1">All I knew was I had ideas.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line15" class="speaker2">What were they?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line16" class="speaker1">Well first I had to explore ‘space’.</p>
                <p id="line16-1" class="speaker1">So I researched how humans actually experience space and</p>
                <p id="line16-2" class="speaker1">the philosophy of spaces, whether social or physical.</p>
                <p id="line16-3" class="speaker1">This is actually important for later!</p>
                <p id="line16-4" class="speaker1">That distinction came up a lot;</p>
                <p id="line16-5" class="speaker1">social and physical space.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line17" class="speaker2">Okay, I’ll remember that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line18" class="speaker1">So I read books!</p>
                <p id="line18-1" class="speaker1">Our tutors also gave us some great suggestions.</p>
                <p id="line18-2" class="speaker1">I read and listened to multiple descriptions studies</p>
                <p id="line18-3" class="speaker1">of the philosophy of Phenomenology. This philosophy</p>
                <p id="line18-4" class="speaker1">became central to the project, in short it is the study</p>
                <p id="line18-5" class="speaker1">of human experience and its relationship to the</p>
                <p id="line18-6" class="speaker1">real world. This relationship was something we studied in</p>
                <p id="line18-7" class="speaker1">depth, especially where this boundary between the two lies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line19" class="speaker2">Interesting…did you find that boundary?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line20" class="speaker1">Later, later, you’re getting ahead of yourself.</p>
                <p id="line20-1" class="speaker1">In that first week of the groups I also read all about</p>
                <p id="line20-2" class="speaker1">Foucault, the architect. I read about his work to design</p>
                <p id="line20-3" class="speaker1">modern utopias. I studied his architecture and books, but</p>
                <p id="line20-4" class="speaker1">also his writings about 'Heterotopias'. These 'other'</p>
                <p id="line20-5" class="speaker1">spaces with contradictory or absurd social and societal</p>
                <p id="line20-6" class="speaker1">implications. I read about Henri LeFebevre and his work on</p>
                <p id="line20-7" class="speaker1">rhythmanalysis and his 'The Social Production of Space'.</p>
                <p id="line20-8" class="speaker1">This related to a book "The Construction of Social Reality"</p>
                <p id="line20-9" class="speaker1">by John Searle. Both of those were about people and how our</p>
                <p id="line20-1-1" class="speaker1">sturctures and behaviour influence the spaces we live in.</p>
                <p id="line20-1-2" class="speaker1">I also read a number of design and architecture books.</p>
                <p id="line20-1-3" class="speaker1">They explained the basic principles of we traditionally</p>
                <p id="line20-1-4" class="speaker1">design spaces.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line21" class="speaker2">So you read books. What else did you do?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line22" class="speaker1">Well...I mean it was the first week.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line23" class="speaker2">But this minor was about a new  tyoe of pedagogy.</p>
                <p id="line23-1" class="speaker2">What is new about reading books?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line24" class="speaker1">Well…</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p id="line26" class="speaker1">Yeah,</p>
                <p id="line26-1" class="speaker1">I suppose it took me too long to begin to experiment.</p>
                <p id="line26-2" class="speaker1">But I felt uncomfortable with my lack of literary</p>
                <p id="line26-3" class="speaker1">knowledge compared to so many others in the group.</p>
                <p id="line26-4" class="speaker1">It was hard, constantly compare myself to people doing</p>
                <p id="line26-5" class="speaker1">studies I myself had wanted to do, and see them doing</p>
                <p id="line26-6" class="speaker1">well in them too. I felt compelled to just learn as</p>
                <p id="line26-7" class="speaker1">much as possible to be able to contribute.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <p id="line27" class="speaker2">You would’ve been able to contribute your own ideas.</p>
                <p id="line27-1" class="speaker2">They need your input. Your ideas.</p>
                <p id="line27-2" class="speaker2">It helps to have lessons from scholars and academics,</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p id="line30" class="speaker1">Well after the second or third meeting,</p>
                <p id="line30-1" class="speaker1">we had to share some more personal aspects of</p>
                <p id="line30-2" class="speaker1">ourselves with the group. People shared books, stories,</p>
                <p id="line30-3" class="speaker1">and artwork. We also shared some ideas; the theme of</p>
                <p id="line30-4" class="speaker1">escapism started to appear.</p>
                <p id="line30-5" class="speaker1">It relates greatly to these concepts of Heterotopia,</p>
                <p id="line30-6" class="speaker1">as well as the social production of space in that</p>
                <p id="line30-7" class="speaker1">the existence of people who want to escape the spaces</p>
                <p id="line30-8" class="speaker1">we have made shows an inherent flaw in the way spaces </p>
                <p id="line30-9" class="speaker1">are being produced.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p id="line32" class="speaker1">I shared the artwork of an artist I like; Sage Jenson.</p>
                <p id="line32-1" class="speaker1">They are a cyber-artist, working with simulations.</p>
                <p id="line32-2" class="speaker1">I specifically liked their slime mold simulations,</p>

            <div class="container">
                <p id="line34" class="speaker1">Well, I started to think about the flaws of space</p>
                <p id="line34-1" class="speaker1">production and the simulations of mold,</p>
                <p id="line34-2" class="speaker1">and this experiment that was done in Tokyo using</p>
                <p id="line34-3" class="speaker1">this mold to design subways.</p>
                <p id="line34-4" class="speaker1">I thought what if we used plants, molds, fungi,</p>
                <p id="line34-5" class="speaker1">natural organisms to design our spaces.</p>
                <p id="line34-6" class="speaker1">If people love nature, forests and fields and such,</p>
                <p id="line34-7" class="speaker1">then if we let them design our spaces,</p>
                <p id="line34-8" class="speaker1">surely they’ll be better.</p>

                <p id="line36" class="speaker1">Yeah, it didn’t go anywhere though.</p>
                <p id="line36-1" class="speaker1">I studied it for a week. I read tonnes of papers</p>
                <p id="line36-2" class="speaker1">about modelling forest density, looked for</p>
                <p id="line36-3" class="speaker1">simulations of fungi and mold growth,</p>
                <p id="line36-4" class="speaker1">even tried making my own.</p>

                <p id="line38" class="speaker1">Well, yeah. Nothing came of it.</p>

                <p id="line39" class="speaker2">Well, think about it now.</p>

                <p id="line54-2" class="speaker1">We divided ourselves into three groups</p>

                <p id="line80" class="speaker1">Well we ended up doing a group experiment,</p>

                <p id="line80-2" class="speaker1">We wanted to learn more about people's</p>

                <p id="line80-4" class="speaker1">This experience was very influential.</p>
                <p id="line80-5" class="speaker1">After, we did a close reading of Sarah Ahmed’s</p>

                <p id="line80-7" class="speaker1">Between this and an amazing reflection of one of our</p>
                <p id="line80-8" class="speaker1">colleagues, sound became a central component of the</p>
                <p id="line80-9" class="speaker1">project.  We gave a presentation to the minor group.</p>
                <p id="line80-1-1" class="speaker1">We really experimented with it,</p>
                <p id="line80-1-2" class="speaker1">making it into a performance.</p>
                <p id="line80-1-3" class="speaker1">It was supposed to feel like a 'guerilla' presentation.</p>
                <p id="line80-1-4" class="speaker1">A peek into our raw conversations and dynamics</p>
                <p id="line80-1-5" class="speaker1">as a group, opening with that reflection I mentioned.</p>
                <p id="line80-1-6" class="speaker1">People really latched onto this idea of sound.</p>
                <p id="line80-1-7" class="speaker1">So, we did too.</p>
                <p id="line80-1-8" class="speaker1">We then took our mid-term break.</p>

                <p id="line82-8" class="speaker1">our group and the project could’ve worked.</p>
